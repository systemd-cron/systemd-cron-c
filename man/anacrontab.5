/etc/anacrontab \- monotonic jobs

.SH DESCRIPTION
The file
.I /etc/anacrontab
follow the rules previously set by \fBanacron(8)\fR.
.PP
Lines starting with '#' are comments.
.PP
Environment variables can be set using
.B VAR=VALUE
keypairs.
.PP

The special
.B RANDOM_DELAY
(in minutes) environment variable is translated to
.B AccuracySec=.

The special
.B START_HOURS_RANGE
(in hours) environment variable is translated to the
.I 'hour'
component of
.B OnCalendar=.
anacron expect a range in the format ##-##, systemd-crontab-generator
only use the starting hour of the range as reference.

The other lines are job-descriptions that follow this layout:
.PP
.B period  delay  job-identifier  command
.PP
.TP
*
.I period
is a number of days to wait between each job execution, or special values @daily, @weekly, @monthly, @yearly
.PP
.TP
*
.I delay
is a number of extra minutes to wait before starting job. It is translated in
.B OnBootSec=
.
.PP
.TP
*
.I job-identifier
is a single word. systemd-crontab-generator uses it to construct the dynamic unit names:
.I cron-<job-identifier>-root-0.timer
and matching
.I cron-<job-identifier>-root-0.service
.PP
.TP
*
.I command
is the command that is run by a shell

.SH BUGS
systemd-crontab-generator doesn't support multiline commands.
.PP
Any
.I period
greater than 30 is rounded to the closest month
.PP
There are subtle differences on how anacron & systemd handle persistente timers:
anacron will run a weekly job at most once a week, with always a minimum delay of 6 days
between runs; where systemd will try to run it every monday at 00:00;
or as soon the system boot. In the most extreme case, if a system was only started on sunday;
a weekly job will run this day and the again the next (mon)day.
.br
There is no difference for the daily job.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
After editing /etc/anacrontab, you can run
.I journalctl -n
and
.I systemctl list-timers
to see if the timers have well been updated.
